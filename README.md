# Intro to Functional Programming - Next Steps

## [Level 0: Boundaries by Gary Bernhardt](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries)

The best talk I've seen on an introduction to the differences between OOP and FP seen from a TDD perspective.

## [Level 2: Functional Libraries](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4)

[Javascript - Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4)
[Java 8 Collection Stream Interface](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/streams/)

## [Level 2: Simple Made Easy by Rich Hickey](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy)

This talk has profoundly influenced the way I think about building software, more than anything else. I rewatch this once every six months. It's very high level though, so it some people find it difficult to apply the concepts discussed while actually writing code.

## [Level 3: Learn You A Haskell For Great Good by Miran Lipovaca](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)

Haskell is more unlike any programming language you've ever worked in. New programming language features have been coming from Haskell features that have been around for a long time so if you're interested in the future of programming languages, get it here first. Haskell is difficult because it lacks quite a few features that you never realized how much you rely on until you don't have them anymore. It will change the way you think about building software forever.

## [Level 4: Category Theory for Programmers by Bartosz Milewski](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/)

Category Theory is the inspiration for the most esoteric/most powerful features in FP. In order to really understand how to design software using FP, you're going to need to dive deep into Applicatives, Functors, and Monads. Incredibly challenging, but totally worth it.
